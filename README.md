# Tour Agency
This project aims at building a mobile first and responsive e-commerce website of a tour company from scratch, using Vanilla CSS. It is a concept project, and uses no CSS libraries for anything, from grid system to the animations. The whole layout and animations are developed using inbuilt features of CSS.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to strengthen and refresh my CSS skills, and that is the most important factor which led to the decision of using only Vanilla CSS. Further, the code is commented in detail and explains what each element does, so can further be used by developers as a CSS primer.
