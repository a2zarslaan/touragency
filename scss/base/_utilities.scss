//having hardcoded utility classes for margin didn't make sense, like u-margin-bottom-8 and u-margin-bottom-2, because it was equivalent to having inline styles in the tags. So we are using more intuitive names and renaming our utility classes for margin. It was hardcoded in a sense as if we wanted to change it to some other number in the future, we'd also have to change the classnames everywhere

  margin-bottom: 8rem;
