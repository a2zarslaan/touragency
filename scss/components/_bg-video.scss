//properties of the bg video conainer
.bg-video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: -1;

  opacity: 0.15;

  &__content {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    //the above properties will fuck up the aspect ration of the video and the fit won't be perfect to the screen. To counter this we will use the newer CSS property called object-fit. Wehn we use this property, the video will still fill its entire parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio
    object-fit: cover;
  }
